### 4. INFRASTRUCTURE / AV VISION (Investor section)
**Language from RBC analyst note (Feb 26, 2026):**
- "Building the physical and digital API for autonomy"
- "A plug-and-play partner ecosystem that likely proves inevitable for almost any AV company coming to market"
- "Underappreciated man-power to run the operations even under the most perfect of tech execution"
- Uber's infrastructure for fleet & operations "strengthens arguments around moat"

**Uber Q4 2025 prepared remarks key quotes:**
- "We will support our AV infrastructure partners as they enter this space"
- "AVs will change how trips are supplied, but not how demand is aggregated"
- "The platform that can bring the highest utilization to assets...will capture a large share of value"
- "We are selectively building capabilities in fleet management, charging infrastructure, financing, data collection, remote assistance, and insurance"
- Austin/Atlanta: "delivering average TpVD around 30% higher than in other major AV markets"

**Peer landscape:**
- **AVOMO** (avomo.com) — Moove's AV unit. Uber's AV fleet partner in Austin & Atlanta. Spanish company. 9,000+ drivers, 4,000+ vehicles, 20M trips in 2024.

- "Infrastructure, Not Algorithms" — the Hertz of autonomous mobility
