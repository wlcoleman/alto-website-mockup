Supplemental Data

1

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Disclosure
To supplement our financial information, which is
prepared and presented in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of
America, or GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP
financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA; Non-GAAP
Operating Income; Non-GAAP Net Income; Non-GAAP
EPS; Non-GAAP Costs and Operating Expenses; Trailing
Twelve Months Adjusted EBITDA; Trailing Twelve Months
Free Cash Flow; Free Cash Flow as well as revenue growth
rates in constant currency. The presentation of this
financial information is not intended to be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial
information prepared and presented in accordance with
GAAP. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for
financial and operational decision-making and as a
means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures
provide meaningful supplemental information regarding
our performance by excluding certain items that may
not be indicative of our recurring core business
operating results.

We believe that both management and investors benefit
from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in
assessing our performance and when planning,
forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These nonGAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s
internal comparisons to our historical performance. We
believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to
investors both because (1) they allow for greater
transparency with respect to key metrics used by
management in its financial and operational decisionmaking and (2) they are used by our institutional investors
and the analyst community to help them analyze the
health of our business.

For more information on these non-GAAP financial
measures, please see the section titled “Non-GAAP
Reconciliations” included at the end of this deck.
In regards to forward looking non-GAAP guidance, we
are not able to reconcile the forward-looking Non-GAAP
EPS and Adjusted EBITDA measures to the closest
corresponding GAAP measures without unreasonable
efforts because we are unable to predict the ultimate
outcome of certain significant items. These items include,
but are not limited to, significant legal settlements,
unrealized gains and losses on equity investments, tax
and regulatory reserve changes, restructuring costs and
acquisition and financing related impacts.

There are a number of limitations related to the use of
non-GAAP financial measures. In light of these limitations
we provide specific information regarding the GAAP
amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial
measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial
measures together with their relevant financial measures
in accordance with GAAP.

Forward Looking Statements
This presentation contains forward-looking statements
regarding our future business expectations, which involve
risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ
materially from the results predicted, and reported results
should not be considered as an indication of future
performance. Forward-looking statements include all
statements that are not historical facts and can be
identified by terms such as “anticipate,” “believe,”
“contemplate,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,”
“hope,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “objective,” “ongoing,”
“plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “target,”
“will,” or “would” or similar expressions and the negatives
of those terms. Forward-looking statements involve
known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors
that may cause our actual results, performance or
achievements to be materially different from any future
results, performance or achievements expressed or
implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks,
uncertainties and other factors relate to, among others:
competition, managing our growth and corporate culture,
financial performance, investments in new products or

offerings, our ability to attract drivers, consumers and
other partners to our platform, our brand and reputation,
other legal and regulatory developments, particularly with
respect to our relationships with drivers and couriers, and
the impact of the global economy, including rising
inflation and interest rates. In addition, other potential
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ from the results predicted include, among others,
those risks and uncertainties included under the captions
“Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended September 30, 2025 and subsequent
annual reports, quarterly reports and other filings filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time
